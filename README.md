# M2_SEAT_HEATING_SYSTEM

The buttons have to be switched on before the app starts working. Potentiometer acts as temperature sensor. It gives signal which is converted by ADC and used to make a PWM signal pf corresponding duty cycle, as seen in the oscilloscope. As potentiometer is varied, message containing detected temperature is shown in serial monitor.
